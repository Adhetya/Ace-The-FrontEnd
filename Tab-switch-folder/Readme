The idea behind this project
This is just like we have many merged folders in a single tab preview.

How does it work
There is 3 tab folder enclosed behind each other and by-default first tab will be previewed and when you will click the second will be previewed similarly Third will also preview after switching.

TECH stack used in this project:
I have used HTML,CSS, and Javascript only.
