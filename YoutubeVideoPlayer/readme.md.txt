This is the project in which I tried to implement the functionality of youtube videoPlayer. It is
built using Javascript And frontend technologies like HTML and CSS
Below are some functionality you can test
1>Play Pause (also try with space)
2>ForwardVideo (for this press right arrow key)
3>ReverseVideo (for this press left arrow key)
4>Unmute and Mute (you can use the icon for this)
And many more
